There's something magical about riding a piece of history through these historic streets. Just finished restoring this 1972 Honda CB750 - six months of work, but seeing it run again is priceless. The inline-four engine sounds like music to my ears. Vintage bikes have so much character and soul! Caf√© racer meetup in the Garden District was incredible - 15 vintage bikes, coffee, and great conversations. The motorcycle community here is amazing - everyone appreciates the classics! #VintageRiding #TriumphBonneville #VintageRestoration #CafeRacerMeetup",
